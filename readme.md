## About Maps In NetSuite

"Maps In NetSuite" is a visualization tool for NetSuite. It uses Geocodio.io to perform Geocoding of addresses and Google Maps API for map visualization. The goal is to empower the user with visual geographical feeback. It has a table built-in as a legend, and "help" boxes to descriptions directly on the map.

You get the idea: this is your visualization.

### Purpose

  Map visualization is an easy way to understand where you are shipping to, and the visual feedback can break made up ideas based on "feels", instead approaching a data understanding.

## Features

  Geocoding on an afterSubmit event.
  Map Visualization.

## Who's it for?

These scripts are for people that understand some NetSuite scripting and want to avoid getting high end, complex and expensive solutions. You're used to scripting, you like working on the project and you don't mind tinkering with some code (hopefully on the Sandbox).
